## Pre-reqs

* pnpm
 
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```


## Notes:

- Some things missing including adding an ErrorBoundary, more work on accessibility, handling error state on API request.
- Ideally the get users would be disabled rather than alerting them when they can't perform the action
-
