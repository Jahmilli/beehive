# Beehive

## Pre-reqs

* pnpm
 
## Getting Started

Install dependencies: `pnpm i`

To run development server, run `pnpm dev`

To test, run: `pnpm test`


## Notes:

- Some things missing including adding an ErrorBoundary, more work on accessibility, handling error state on API request.
- Ideally the get users would be disabled rather than alerting them when they can't perform the action
